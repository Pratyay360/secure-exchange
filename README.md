# Secure Exchange - Encryption Platform

A modern web application for secure message encryption and decryption using both AES (symmetric) and ECC (asymmetric) cryptography. Built with Next.js and powered by Web Crypto API and iso-crypto.

## Features

### üîê Dual Encryption Support
- **AES Encryption**: Fast symmetric encryption with customizable key lengths (1-256 characters)
- **ECC Encryption**: Elliptic Curve Cryptography using P-256 curve for public-key encryption

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First
- All encryption/decryption happens client-side in your browser
- No data is stored on servers - complete privacy
- Uses Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure operations
- Industry-standard encryption algorithms

### üé® Modern UI/UX
- Clean, responsive design with dark/light theme support
- Intuitive dock navigation for easy access to all features
- Real-time feedback with toast notifications
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Encryption Methods

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Use Case**: When you can securely share a key beforehand
- **Type**: Symmetric encryption (same key for encrypt/decrypt)
- **Key Length**: Customizable from 1-256 characters
- **Speed**: Very fast encryption/decryption

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- **Use Case**: When you can't share keys in advance
- **Type**: Asymmetric encryption (public/private key pair)
- **Curve**: P-256 (NIST recommended)
- **Security**: Strong security with smaller key sizes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
